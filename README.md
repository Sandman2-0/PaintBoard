This is a drawing program I've created to simply re-visit Processing after not using it for a while. Along with that, I also created this program to practice hosting Java apps on my [website](https://sandman2-0.com/).

# Overview
This program allows you to get creative at any moment while including a variety of features, all compiled into a slick user interface.

Download the source code here: https://github.com/Sandman2-0/PaintBoard/blob/main/PaintBoard/paint_board.pde

To try this program for yourself, you may install the [Processing](https://processing.org/) IDE or view it directly through your browser [here](https://draw.sandman2-0.com/).

**NOTE:** When trying to paint too quickly, you'll find that the line tends to break apart. To fix this issue, increase the framerate within ``void setup()`` in the programs code.
